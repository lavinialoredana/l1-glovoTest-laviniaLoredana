# Code Assignment

This project is configured for you to get started.
It includes a dependency: `node-fetch`, so you can use the fetch API inside this project.
You can read more about the fetch API in [the Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

Remember to run `npm install` to download the library inside the project.

## Running the project

You can write your code in as many separate files as you want.
You should import your code inside the `src/index.js` file, which you can run using the project's _test_ script:

```bash
npm run test
```
